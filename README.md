Bootcamp Challenge: Lyrics of the song 99 Bottles of Beer (While Loop)
I developed a code to write out the '99 Bottles of Beer' lyrics using a While Loop as part of the Bootcamp challenge, ensuring correct grammar in the last statements, by handling singular words and scenarios without numbers. 
This challenge allowed me to strengthen my understanding of loop structures and their application in coding.
I made an effort to elucidate the rationale behind every variable and function in the code.

Please let me know if you think I can improve the code.
